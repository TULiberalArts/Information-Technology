The Liberal Arts Media Library, a service of the College of Liberal Arts, is home to thousands of VHS tapes, DVDs, 16mm film reels, slides, and printed texts. The Media Library catalog covers a wide range of academic interests with a focus on the social sciences and humanities. The complete index of available titles is accessible in the [Temple University Library](https://library.temple.edu/). When searching the Library catalog you can refine your search to just CLA Media Library titles by choosing 'CLA Ed Tech Library' under 'Library' in the 'Limit My Search' menu of available locations.
