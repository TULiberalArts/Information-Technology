## Printing

All College of Liberal Arts labs contain printers supported by CLA IT. Printing is available in all computer lab and computer classrooms. Computer labs in the College of Liberal Arts act in accordance with [Temple University's student printing policies](https://computerservices.temple.edu/student-printing-temple-university-computer-labs).

Students are also able to print from any device connected to Temple University's wireless network.
