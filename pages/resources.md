## Learning Spaces

The College of Liberal Arts houses classrooms, meeting rooms, and shared learning spaces on Main Campus ranging from small 10-seat meeting and 14-seat seminar rooms to a 626-seat lecture hall. All classrooms contain either a blackboard or dry erase board, student seating with writing surface, and either a fixed smart classroom system or facilities to support the delivery of portable technology equipment. Meeting spaces have the same features but do not always include a student writing surface.

## ArcGIS Online / ESRI Training

ESRI provides Geographic Information System (GIS) software, with ArcGIS as their flagship product. Temple University’s license of ESRI products includes the [“ESRI Virtual Campus][esritraining]” online training courses. The Virtual Campus has  a number of course offerings ranging from the introductory "Learning ArcGIS Desktop" to specialized courses covering ArcPad, 3D Analyst, and ArcCatalog products.

Access to ESRI online courses are available to the faculty, students, and staff of the units contributing to Temple University’s ESRI site license at no charge to the individual or their department.

To obtain access to courses, please enter a [TUhelp request](http://tuhelp.temple.edu) listing "CLA IT" as the referral consultant. Be sure to include the course number and full title.

After submitting your request, you will be e-mailed codes and instructions on how to access
the ESRI training site and begin the online course. Codes will only be e-mailed to valid temple.edu
e-mail addresses. Individual codes are required for each person taking each course. Codes can’t be shared under any circumstance. If you are an instructor seeking codes for your entire class, special
arrangements can be made for you to self-generate codes for your students.

Please visit the [ESRI Training and Education site](http://campus.esri.com) and choose Self Study / Virtual Campus for available course offerings.
