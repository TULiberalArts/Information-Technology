## Liberal Arts Media Library

The Liberal Arts Media Library, a service of the College of Liberal Arts, is home to thousands of VHS tapes, DVDs, 16mm film reels, slides, and printed texts. The Media Library catalog covers a wide range of academic interests with a focus on the social sciences and humanities. The complete index of available titles is accessible in Temple University Library's [Diamond catalog](https://diamond.temple.edu/search/). When searching the Diamond Catalog choose 'CLA Ed Tech Center' in the dropdown list of available collections to search for titles in the Liberal Arts Media Library.

Faculty and approved graduate students may check out up to 3 videos for a maximum of 7 days, while undergraduate students may only check out one video at a time and must remain in the lab. Faculty who want to reserve a film can complete the online reservation form or visit the counter in AL 21.

To search through the database of available media, please use the Diamond System. Please note that you must modify your search from "View Entire Collection" to "CLA Ed Tech Center" in order to search only the MLC collection.

The Media Library is located within the AL21 Anderson Hall drop-in computer lab and follows the same hours of operation as Liberal Arts Computer Labs.
