GIS (Geographic Information System) software empowers us to visualize, query and analyze geographic data.

ArcGIS Desktop and ArcGIS Online are the industry standard GIS software applications from Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI). Through a site license with ESRI the College of Liberal Arts provides all students, faculty, and staff at Temple University access to ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online.

If you require assistance with additional ESRI services, software, or licensing, please submit a [TUhelp request][tuhelp].
