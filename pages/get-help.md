# Help in a Classroom

For help in a classroom press the "Help Button" located on the podium touch-screen control system.

Classrooms across campus are supported by Classroom Technical Support (CTS) who are based out of offices close to the locations they support. Computer labs located within the College Liberal Arts are directly supported by Liberal Arts Information Technology staff (CLA IT).


# Help in an Office or Research Area

For technology assistance in your office or research area, please submit an online support request using [TUhelp][tuhelp]. TUhelp allows you to create, update, and track the status of your help requests.

In addition to the TUhelp website you may also contact the Temple University Help Desk by emailing [help@temple.edu][hd-email], via phone [215-204-8000][hd-phone], live chat, or walk-in. The Help Desk is located on the ground floor of the [TECH Center][techcenter] in room 106.
