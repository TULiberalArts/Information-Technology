## Help in a Classroom

Please use the telephone located in the classroom to call for assistance or press the "Help Button" located on the touch-screen control system.

Different groups on campus service different areas and you will find a placard next to the telephone detailing which group or depot serves the lab or classroom that you are in.

CLA IT labs are supported by CLA IT out of Anderson Hall 21 and can be reached during operating hours at 215-204-3213.

Classrooms in Anderson and Gladfelter Halls are supported by the Anderson Hall Classroom Technical Support (CTS) depot and can be reached at 215-204-8572.

Classrooms in Weiss, Ritter Hall, and Ritter Annex are supported by the Ritter Hall Classroom Technical Support (CTS) depot and can be reached at 215-204-0131.

It is our goal to provide classroom assistance in five minutes or less during business hours.

It is CLA IT's goal to provide desk-side assistance in one to four business hours. However, at just before and at the start of the fall and spring semesters, this is not always possible due to the volume of requests.
