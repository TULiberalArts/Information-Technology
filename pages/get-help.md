# Help in a Classroom

**For help in a classroom please press the "Help Button" located on the podium touch-screen control system.**

Classrooms across campus are supported by Classroom Technical Support (CTS) who are based out of offices close to the locations they support. Computer labs located within the College Liberal Arts are directly supported by Liberal Arts Information Technology staff (CLA IT).


# Help in an Office or Research Area

**For technology assistance in a faculty office, administrative office, or research area please submit a support request using [TUhelp][tuhelp].**

[TUhelp][tuhelp] is an online service for creating, updating, and monitoring the status of support requests. Please specify "_CLA IT_" as the referral consultant when requesting technical support via [TUhelp][tuhelp] for Liberal Arts supported areas and equipment as doing so will help expedite requests to the attention of CLA IT desktop support staff.

In addition to [TUhelp][tuhelp] the [Temple University Help Desk][helpdesk] can be reached via email [help@temple.edu][hd-email], telephone [215-204-8000][hd-phone], live chat, or walk-in. The Help Desk is located on the ground floor of the [TECH Center][techcenter] in room 106.
